     This XML file declares which system apps should be exempted from the hidden API blacklisting, i.e.
     which apps should be allowed to access the entire private API.

     Only apps NOT signed with the platform cert need to be included, as apps signed with the platform
     cert are exempted by default.

     Do NOT include any apps that are updatable via Play Store!
